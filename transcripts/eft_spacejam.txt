The very first version of what later became Slam Dunk, a popular map I created for the Garry's Mod gamemode Extreme Football Throwdown. I uploaded this for legacy/nostalgic reasons, as it was never uploaded to any server running the gamemode. This version was done by lerp, a well known member of the NoXiousnet EFT server.
