A sky map for EFT because everyone loves sky maps.

Notes:
-Map layout started by Madden, finished by me.
-Players spawn inside the glass domes, which gets them right to the ballspawn quickly.
-Goals are stationary spheres in the air, score by throwing the ball at the sphere.
-2 Speedball power-ups, lasting 6 seconds.
