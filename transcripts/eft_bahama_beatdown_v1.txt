Map Notes:
- Odd island map, with plenty of assorted trees to make up for empty space.
- Speed Ball lasts 10 seconds, can be activated by running into the yellow sprite.
- Players spawn on pirate ships. Jump down into the water and swim to the coast to get to the main playing area.
- Difficult throw in touchdowns that should seem familiar.
- Pirate ships taken from ze_potc, I removed unneeded parts, and changed some textures around.
- Of course thanks to dissident for helping out.
