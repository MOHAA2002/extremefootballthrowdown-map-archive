Map Notes:
- Colosseum map, Based off Arena in Chivalry.
- Speed Ball lasts 4 seconds, can be activated by running into the yellow sprite.
- Doors, similar to Castle Warfare.
- Run in touchdowns.
- Colosseum itself taken from gm_colosseum, I added the parts within it and the lower level.
- Thanks to dissident for helping improve the map.
