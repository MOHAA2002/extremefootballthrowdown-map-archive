A linear raving hallway which gurantees cluster♥♥♥♥s

Map Notes:
- Takes place in a small, futuristic hallway with strobing lights and neat beats to gurantee a nifty experience
- Based off a custom Halo Reach map of the same name
- Contains a neon arsenal of weaponry (melons, missiles, logs, and beatdown sticks)
- Spinning cubes that randomly cycle between every powerup (speed, blitz, magnet, ice, score, and feather). Water ball not included for obvious reasons
- Everything that is glass in this map can be broken with explosives/wands
- Endzones are at the end of the hall
